# RS Rust Audio
Audio library in Rust. Currently includes biquad filter module. Running in Cargo currently filters `this_is_a_test.wav` into `filtered_speech.wav`. Will add more modules, including reverbs and distortions.

## Running
Typing `cargo run` into the terminal will filter the included .wav file. More terminal options to come later.
